# 📧 Fraud Email Detection using Machine Learning

A Python-based cybersecurity project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to detect **fraudulent (phishing/spam)** emails. The goal is to help users or systems identify potentially harmful emails before they are opened or acted upon.

---

## 🔍 Features

* Detects whether an email is **fraudulent or legitimate**
* Uses **TF-IDF** vectorization for feature extraction from email text
* Trained using **Naive Bayes**, a lightweight and fast-performing model for text classification
* Provides **real-time prediction function** for custom emails
* Outputs detailed **accuracy and performance metrics**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Machine Learning (Naive Bayes)

## 📂 Project Structure

```
fraud_email_detection/
│
├── dataset.csv                # Email data with labels (0 = legit, 1 = fraud)
├── fraud_email_detector.py    # Main training and prediction script
└── README.md                  # Project overview and documentation
```

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset must contain two columns:

* `text` – the email content
* `label` – `1` for fraudulent/spam emails, `0` for legitimate ones

Example:

```csv
text,label
"Urgent! Your account has been locked. Click to verify.",1
"Team meeting scheduled for Monday at 10 AM.",0
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

2. **Place `dataset.csv` in the project folder**

3. **Run the script**:

```bash
python fraud_email_detector.py
```

4. **Test with your own message**:
   You'll be prompted to enter an email message to check if it’s fraud or not.

## 🧠 Example Output

```
Accuracy: 96.2%

Classification Report:
    precision  recall  f1-score  support
    ...

Test Email: Urgent! Update your banking information now.
Result: Fraudulent
```

## ✅ Future Improvements

* Add a web or GUI interface (using Flask or Tkinter)
* Use deep learning (e.g., LSTM or BERT) for better accuracy
* Add real email input parsing (from `.eml` files or Gmail API)
